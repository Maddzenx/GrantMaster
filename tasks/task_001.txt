# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js project with Tailwind CSS, configure Supabase integration, and set up the development environment.
# Details:
1. Create a new Next.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest grantmaster --typescript`
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS following the official documentation
3. Set up Supabase client integration:
   - Install packages: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
   - Create environment variables for Supabase URL and anon key
   - Create a utils/supabase.ts file with client initialization
4. Configure project structure:
   - pages/ - for Next.js routes
   - components/ - for reusable UI components
   - lib/ - for utility functions
   - services/ - for API integrations
   - styles/ - for global styles
5. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
6. Configure Git repository with appropriate .gitignore

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Next.js application builds and runs without errors
2. Confirm Tailwind CSS is properly configured by testing a sample component
3. Test Supabase connection by making a simple query
4. Ensure all development scripts work as expected (dev, build, start, lint)
