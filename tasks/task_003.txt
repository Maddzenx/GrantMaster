# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Vinnova API Integration Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service to fetch, parse, and store grant data from the Vinnova GDP API, including a daily synchronization mechanism.
# Details:
1. Create a VinnovaService class in services/vinnova.ts:
   - Implement methods for each GDP API endpoint (/calls, /applications, /activities, /metadata)
   - Add proper error handling and retry logic
   - Include response type definitions based on API documentation
2. Create data normalization functions:
   - Parse API responses into consistent internal data structures
   - Handle edge cases and missing data
3. Implement Supabase database schema:
   - Create 'grants' table with appropriate columns (title, description, deadline, criteria, etc.)
   - Add indexes for efficient querying
4. Create a sync service:
   - Implement incremental sync logic to fetch only new/updated grants
   - Add data comparison to detect changes
   - Include logging for sync operations
5. Set up a daily cron job using Vercel Cron or similar service:
   - Configure API route at pages/api/cron/sync-grants.ts
   - Implement authentication for cron endpoint
   - Add detailed logging for monitoring
6. Implement fallback logic to older APIs if GDP API fails

# Test Strategy:
1. Create mock responses for Vinnova API endpoints for testing
2. Test API integration with actual Vinnova endpoints
3. Verify data normalization correctly handles various response formats
4. Test incremental sync logic with sample data
5. Verify cron job authentication and execution
6. Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
7. Measure sync performance with large datasets
