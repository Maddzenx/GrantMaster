STATUS UPDATE: Task partially implemented but on hold. Local development security measures are in place, but full implementation of HTTPS, CORS, and production security headers requires a production domain. This subtask will be resumed and finalized once the production domain is set up.

## 3. Build Error Handling System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Develop a centralized error handling system with custom error classes, error boundaries, and consistent error responses across the application.
### Details:
1. Create custom error classes for different error types
2. Implement global error handling middleware
3. Add React error boundaries for frontend components
4. Standardize error response format across all APIs
5. Implement graceful degradation for critical features
6. Create user-friendly error messages
7. Test error handling with simulated failures
8. Document error handling patterns for developers

## Implementation Plan for Centralized Error Handling System

### 1. Custom Error Classes
- Use `lib/errors.ts` as the central place for custom error classes (e.g., `ApiError`, `ValidationError`, `AuthError`, `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`, `InternalServerError`).
- Extend as needed for new error types (e.g., service-specific errors).

### 2. Global API Error Handling Middleware
- Use `lib/handleApiError.ts` to standardize error logging and API error responses.
- Ensure all API routes (e.g., in `pages/api/`) use `handleApiError` in their catch blocks.
- All error responses should use a consistent format: `{ error: string, ...context }`.
- Log errors using `logError` for traceability.

### 3. React Error Boundaries
- Use `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` for client-side error boundaries in React.
- Wrap top-level components/pages with `ErrorBoundary` to catch and display user-friendly error messages.
- Provide a fallback UI and a reset mechanism.

### 4. Standardize Error Response Format
- Ensure all API endpoints return errors in the same JSON structure (status code, error message, optional requestId/context).
- Use custom error classes to set appropriate status codes and messages.

### 5. Graceful Degradation
- In API routes (e.g., `pages/api/vinnova/utlysningar.ts`), serve cached or fallback data when possible if an error occurs (e.g., circuit breaker open, rate limit, or upstream failure).
- Communicate degraded state to the client with clear warnings in the response.

### 6. User-Friendly Error Messages
- Avoid exposing stack traces or sensitive details in API responses.
- Provide clear, actionable error messages for common failure cases (validation, auth, rate limit, not found).

### 7. Testing Error Handling
- Write tests to simulate various error scenarios (invalid input, auth failure, rate limit, server error).
- Ensure correct status codes and error messages are returned.
- Use supertest or similar tools for API endpoint tests.

### 8. Documentation
- Document error handling patterns and conventions in a dedicated section (e.g., `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md`).
- Include examples of error classes, API error responses, and usage of ErrorBoundary.

### Files/Modules Affected
- `lib/errors.ts` (custom error classes)
- `lib/handleApiError.ts` (API error handler)
- `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (React error boundary)
- `pages/api/*` (API route handlers)
- `lib/log.ts` (logging)
- `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md` (documentation)
- Test files in `components/auth/__tests__/` and similar

### Anticipated Challenges
- Ensuring all API routes consistently use the error handler
- Avoiding information leakage in error responses
- Coordinating error handling between frontend and backend
- Handling third-party service errors gracefully
