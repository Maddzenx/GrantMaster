Document error handling patterns for developers\n<info added on 2025-06-07T11:39:40.985Z>\n## Implementation Plan for Centralized Error Handling System\n\n### 1. Custom Error Classes\n- Use `lib/errors.ts` as the central place for custom error classes (e.g., `ApiError`, `ValidationError`, `AuthError`, `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`, `InternalServerError`).\n- Extend as needed for new error types (e.g., service-specific errors).\n\n### 2. Global API Error Handling Middleware\n- Use `lib/handleApiError.ts` to standardize error logging and API error responses.\n- Ensure all API routes (e.g., in `pages/api/`) use `handleApiError` in their catch blocks.\n- All error responses should use a consistent format: `{ error: string, ...context }`.\n- Log errors using `logError` for traceability.\n\n### 3. React Error Boundaries\n- Use `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` for client-side error boundaries in React.\n- Wrap top-level components/pages with `ErrorBoundary` to catch and display user-friendly error messages.\n- Provide a fallback UI and a reset mechanism.\n\n### 4. Standardize Error Response Format\n- Ensure all API endpoints return errors in the same JSON structure (status code, error message, optional requestId/context).\n- Use custom error classes to set appropriate status codes and messages.\n\n### 5. Graceful Degradation\n- In API routes (e.g., `pages/api/vinnova/utlysningar.ts`), serve cached or fallback data when possible if an error occurs (e.g., circuit breaker open, rate limit, or upstream failure).\n- Communicate degraded state to the client with clear warnings in the response.\n\n### 6. User-Friendly Error Messages\n- Avoid exposing stack traces or sensitive details in API responses.\n- Provide clear, actionable error messages for common failure cases (validation, auth, rate limit, not found).\n\n### 7. Testing Error Handling\n- Write tests to simulate various error scenarios (invalid input, auth failure, rate limit, server error).\n- Ensure correct status codes and error messages are returned.\n- Use supertest or similar tools for API endpoint tests.\n\n### 8. Documentation\n- Document error handling patterns and conventions in a dedicated section (e.g., `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md`).\n- Include examples of error classes, API error responses, and usage of ErrorBoundary.\n\n### Files/Modules Affected\n- `lib/errors.ts` (custom error classes)\n- `lib/handleApiError.ts` (API error handler)\n- `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (React error boundary)\n- `pages/api/*` (API route handlers)\n- `lib/log.ts` (logging)\n- `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md` (documentation)\n- Test files in `components/auth/__tests__/` and similar\n\n### Anticipated Challenges\n- Ensuring all API routes consistently use the error handler\n- Avoiding information leakage in error responses\n- Coordinating error handling between frontend and backend\n- Handling third-party service errors gracefully\n</info added on 2025-06-07T11:39:40.985Z>",
