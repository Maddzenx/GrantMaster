# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure authentication system using Supabase Auth with email and password login, registration, and session management.
# Details:
1. Create authentication components:
   - SignUp.tsx: Registration form with email, password, and confirmation
   - SignIn.tsx: Login form with email and password
   - ResetPassword.tsx: Password reset functionality
   - AuthLayout.tsx: Wrapper for auth pages
2. Implement Supabase Auth hooks and context:
   - Create AuthContext.tsx to manage auth state
   - Implement useAuth() hook for components to access auth state
   - Add signUp, signIn, signOut, and resetPassword functions
3. Create protected routes using Next.js middleware:
   - Create middleware.ts to check auth status on protected routes
   - Redirect unauthenticated users to login
4. Add session persistence:
   - Handle token refresh
   - Store session in localStorage
   - Implement auto-logout on session expiration
5. Create user profile table in Supabase to store additional user data

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user registration with valid and invalid inputs
2. Test login functionality with correct and incorrect credentials
3. Verify password reset flow works end-to-end
4. Confirm protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
5. Test session persistence across page refreshes
6. Verify logout functionality clears session data

# Subtasks:

Implementation steps:
1. Set up AuthContext with React Context API
   - Create a new file (e.g., `AuthContext.tsx` or `AuthContext.js`) in the components or lib directory
   - Define the context value shape: user, session, loading, signIn, signOut, signUp, etc.
   - Provide the context at the top level of your app (e.g., in `layout.tsx`)
   - Use createContext and useContext from React

2. Implement useAuth hook for accessing authentication state
   - Create a custom hook (`useAuth`) that returns the context value
   - Ensure it throws an error if used outside the provider
   - Example: `const { user, signIn, signOut } = useAuth()`

3. Create login, logout, and registration functions
   - Use Supabase Auth methods: `signInWithPassword`, `signUp`, `signOut`
   - Handle errors and loading states
   - Implement password reset and email verification support
   - Update context state after successful authentication actions

4. Add token storage and retrieval mechanisms
   - Use Supabase's built-in session management
   - Listen for auth state changes with `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`
   - Update context state on session/user changes
   - Consider using cookies for enhanced security

5. Implement user state persistence
   - On app load, check for an existing session with `supabase.auth.getSession()`
   - Restore user/session state if available
   - Handle loading state until session is determined
   - Implement proper error handling for session restoration failures

6. Add refresh token functionality
   - Leverage Supabase's automatic token refresh capabilities
   - Ensure context updates on refresh events
   - Implement auto-logout on session expiration
   - Set a timeout based on `expires_at` for client-side expiration handling

Security considerations:
- Use secure storage for tokens (HttpOnly cookies preferred)
- Implement token expiration and rotation
- Add fingerprinting for additional security
- Sanitize user data before storing
- Handle errors gracefully without leaking sensitive information
- Implement proper CSRF protection

Test cases:
- Test context initialization with/without existing session
- Verify hook behavior in authenticated/unauthenticated states
- Test token refresh mechanisms
- Confirm proper state updates after auth actions
- Verify secure storage implementation
- Test login, logout, and registration flows
- Verify error handling for authentication failures

Code structure:
```
/lib
  /auth
    AuthContext.tsx  // Context definition and provider
    useAuth.tsx      // Custom hook for accessing auth context
    authUtils.ts     // Helper functions for auth operations
```

## 3. Protected Routes Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement middleware to protect routes that require authentication and handle authorization levels.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create ProtectedRoute component/HOC
2. Implement role-based access control
3. Add redirect logic for unauthenticated users
4. Set up route guards for different permission levels
5. Implement loading states during authentication checks
6. Add error handling for expired sessions

Security considerations:
- Verify token validity on each protected route access
- Implement proper redirection for unauthorized access attempts
- Log security-related events for auditing
- Consider implementing route-specific permissions

Test cases:
- Test access to protected routes with/without authentication
- Verify redirects to login page when unauthenticated
- Test role-based access restrictions
- Confirm proper handling of expired tokens
- Verify loading states during authentication checks

## 4. Session Management [done]

Implementation Log:
1. Token Storage Strategy:
   - Implemented using Supabase JS v2+ which uses localStorage by default for session tokens in the browser
   - Centralized Supabase client creation in app/lib/supabase.js for consistent usage across client components
   - Verified session persistence across page refreshes via localStorage (sb-<project-id>-auth-token)
   - Note: Current implementation doesn't persist across browser restarts due to localStorage limitations

2. Automatic Token Refresh:
   - Leveraged Supabase JS built-in token refresh functionality via onAuthStateChange and getSession
   - Implemented AuthProvider to listen for auth state changes and update context accordingly

3. Session Timeout Detection/Handling:
   - Added timeout mechanism in AuthProvider based on session.expires_at
   - Implemented auto-logout functionality when session expires
   - Configured handlers in setAutoLogout and onAuthStateChange in AuthProvider.tsx

4. Session Recovery:
   - Implemented session restoration on application mount using supabase.auth.getSession()
   - Ensured users remain logged in after page refresh when valid session exists

5. Multi-Device Session Management:
   - Created secure API route (app/api/revoke-sessions/route.ts) using Supabase Admin API
   - Implemented functionality to revoke all sessions for a user

6. Session Revocation:
   - Completed revoke-sessions API route for session termination across all devices
   - Added UI trigger via 'Log Out Everywhere' button

All client-side session management with Supabase has been implemented and tested. Future enhancements could include SSR support or cookie-based authentication for improved security.
