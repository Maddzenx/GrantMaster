Summary of Sync Service Implementation:

- Implemented incremental sync logic using a sync_state table and last_synced_at timestamps for each entity.
- Added conflict resolution: for each upsert, compares updated_at timestamps and uses the latest (last write wins).
- Logging and error handling: all sync operations, conflicts, and errors are logged for traceability.
- Idempotent operations: upserts are used to avoid duplicates and ensure safe re-runs.
- Partial success handling: failed records are logged to a sync_failures table for later reconciliation.
- Data reconciliation: added a retryFailedSyncs function to reprocess failed records and mark them as resolved if successful.
- Alerting: critical failures and all-record failures trigger Slack alerts via webhook.
- Performance: implemented parallel processing with configurable batch size for upserts.
- Progress tracking: after each batch, progress is logged and upserted to a sync_progress table for UI/monitoring.

Remaining issues/next steps:
- Ensure all edge cases for conflict resolution are covered (e.g., missing updated_at).
- Monitor and tune batch size for optimal performance.
- Optionally, build a UI/dashboard for monitoring progress and failures.
- Continue to test with real data and monitor for unexpected errors or bottlenecks.
